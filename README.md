Repository with stuff for my channel https://youtube.com/user/bjornregnell

## How to contribute with timestamps?

* [Watch a video](https://github.com/bjornregnell/mytube/blob/master/play/programmering.md) without [timestamps](https://github.com/bjornregnell/mytube/tree/master/timestamps). A video with missing timestamps lacks a file in the `timestamps` folder of the current year of this repo.

* While watching take notes on every topic/concept/headline, similar to (but with *real* stuff). Check the slides for headings and write the headings (in Swedish):
  ```
  00:00 Intro
  03:45 Headline a
  05:01 Topic y, topic z
  ```
  etc

* The more timestamps with good concepts/headings/topics the better to help watchers find specific stuff in the videos.

* Make at least one stamp per slide heading, the first stamp being the actual heading as written on the slide.
* Use the same terminology as used on the slides in the video. 
  * Slides are available here: http://cs.lth.se/pgk/allslides/ 
  * Topics are available for each lecture here: http://cs.lth.se/pgk/foerelaesningar/

* Commit, Push to your fork (it's not necessary to create a branch if you dont want to)
* Create a Pull Request (PR) 

### If you don't know git & github: paste your timestamps in comments

If you have no clue about what fork, clone, commit, branch, push, pull request etc. means, then you can *simply just* **copy-paste** your timestamps in the comment section of the respective [video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEV42dlCGAJ-0925_wTUFt_XiXfnimIVX) and bjorn.regnell@cs.lth.se will hopefully see it and update the info section with your contribution. If it takes to long then I might have forgotten about it and I'd be glad for a reminder via email :)
